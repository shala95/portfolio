## Introduction

This project involves the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and model text data. The work includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training various NLP models to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Project Structure

NLP.ipynb: Notebook containing the NLP analysis and model training.
Setup and Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
```
### The dataset consists of text data that has been preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. Steps include:

Text cleaning (removal of punctuation, lowercasing, etc.)
Tokenization
Removal of stopwords
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of the text data, identify common words and phrases, and visualize text patterns. Details are available in NLP.ipynb.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Various NLP models were trained and evaluated, including:

Bag-of-Words (BoW) models
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) models
Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
Deep Learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU)
Results

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations are documented in the NLP.ipynb notebook.
